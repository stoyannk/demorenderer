============

The project contains some of the base code I use for rendering experiments and demos.

The main rendering is based on a Forward+ technique.
There is support for procedurally generated meshed through polygonizing distance fields on the GPU with compute shaders.

The project depends on my "DX11 Framework" available here: https://github.com/stoyannk/dx11-framework
